Data Visualization Dashboard Explanation





Project Overview





The Data Visualization Dashboard is a web application designed to visualize data from a given JSON file using interactive charts and graphs. The dashboard is built using the MERN stack (MongoDB, Express.js, React.js, Node.js) along with D3.js and Chart.js for data visualization. This project aims to provide users with insightful visualizations and interactive features to analyze various attributes in the data.





Key Features
1.Data Visualization: The dashboard uses D3.js and Chart.js to create interactive and dynamic visualizations.
2.MERN Stack: The project leverages MongoDB for the database, Express.js and Node.js for the backend, and React.js for the frontend.
3.API Integration: Node.js APIs are used to fetch data from the MongoDB database.
4.Filters and Controls: Users can filter data based on various attributes such as end year, topics, sector, region, PEST, source, SWOT, country, and city.
